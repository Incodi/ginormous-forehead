# ginormous forehead

This is an absolutely ridiculous joke/passion project for a funny post for u/smoresaretasty to post on r/SLGreddit that matches the theme of the posts there.
This makes the catalogue of smoresaretasty (me) much more diverse and ridiculous.

This project is based off of Endless Horse.
I customized it to match the Crainer forehead joke while adding cases that make text or ASCII art appear while scrolling.

I could use this code for a better idea for the future. soon.
